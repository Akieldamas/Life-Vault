## Return to The Shop to feel how it felt having a game you feel proud of.

- Is my interest in all these things _equal_, or is one just more fun to think about than to _do_?
    
- Am I more in love with the idea of “being good at it” than actually grinding with it?

- Are you still clinging to older goals that made sense to a previous version of yourself?
    
- Or are you sensing a new self forming, but haven't figured out how to **trust** or **define** it yet?

- Do I actually enjoy learning for its own sake right now? Or am I avoiding the anxiety of starting something imperfect?
    
- When I _don’t create_, is it because I don’t know where to start — or because I fear it won’t be “good enough”?

- Am I trying to turn a comfort activity (playing games) into a responsibility (making them)?
    
- Do I feel like game dev _should_ be my thing just because I like games?
- 
“Am I expecting myself to do something I don’t currently have the mental bandwidth for — and blaming myself for not doing it anyway?”

- Which of these things do I feel **calm and energized** when doing, not just thinking about?
    
- What am I chasing: _Mastery? Identity? Fun? Recognition?_ Be honest.
    
- If I could only do one of these for a month, just to explore deeply, which one would I feel curious to wake up to?

When I joined a team and worked in a game with some people I had really much fun because of the community and everything. I played recently an old tiny game I made and I had a huge sense of self proud. The problem with game dev is that I work on something but then I drop it a few weeks later (unconsciously). A way that I managed to work well was not interacting with my friends for a week, so I suppose it's because I Love my friends and want to be with them. Linux I started using because I FOund customisation really sick, I was planning today to make my own GRUB Menu theme for the bootloader. And start usign arch linux everyday to test it out and more customizing and stuff. (but new programming languages to learn) I do honestly avoid anxiety by playing games which I feel terrible for though it's automatic, I sometimes try to force myself... then there's the usage of AI In programming which just makes me feel bad because I Know that if I use it, I'd be able to code things fast (but it's important to ACTUALLY think by yourself)
