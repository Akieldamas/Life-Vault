### What I did today:
- Today I did presentation at school which didn't end up well... I talked for too long and I had too many things to talk about (though they said it was interesting), I have to make it better for the [[Review Finale]]. 
- I didn't do much but I studied a bit on Linux distros and I know which to pick for tomorrow!! POP OS!
- Uhh... I also went with my friends, which was amazing, I even got some pictures.. We ate Asian food too... and ducks attacked!!!
- Did some CRs to find a PD for my friend frel, well I found one but he got one too so we chilling! Gave it to my Shinobi instead.
