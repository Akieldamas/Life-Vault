2025-05-28 (Project: #daily-life #school #projet-final  #game-project )

### What I did today:
- Woke up a bit late, went to school either way. We worked a bit, laughed a bit, managed to make my reinforcement start working a bit and got a few results, gotta continue!!
- Didn't do much on Studio but it's ok, tomorrow I'll do more.
- Talked with Birb, things should calm down a bit more.. 
* I think that manga recap played a bit weirdly... That bullying story from Birb felt so strange.. on the same day I watched a manga about bullying, heh..
* Managed to make Sober works on Linux, though Vinegar (for Studio) doesn't work yet. I made a post in the discord server and hope people answer.
* I joined on my old account to see if I got messages which I did. Things seem to be doing well, kofdiya managed to make that idea of putting items you can't see away which seemed to have positive results. Gotta work on the animations, she deserves it.

### Reflection:
I think today was a bit exhausting, small progress but I'm fine about it.
