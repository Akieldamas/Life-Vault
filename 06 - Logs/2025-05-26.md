2025-05-26 (Project: #rogue-project)

### What I did today:
- Today I worked on my GRUB theme!!! It looks so awesome but not finished!
- I also started the "rogue lineage-like", with the combat. Made M1s, blocking work, made a few sfx. scripting is quick and not very good but it works and it's nice. there's also ragdoll. Though honestly, it feels more like those silly fight games xDD where you just beat ppl

### Word Count:

### Reflection:
