2025-05-27 (Project: #school #projet-final  #rogue-project)

### What I did today:
- Today I went to school and worked a bit on the Reinforcement Learning AI, me and Naoufel also found the pieces that were stolen and we took off the glue. 
- I played some Rogue Lineage to do some castle rocks, didn't get much and sadly the Metascroom died.. :(.
* I scripted a bit on the combat for the "rogue lineage" like, but it's honestly looking more like a silly combat XD
### Word Count:

### Reflection:
Hmmm... Nothing much to say, roleplayed a bit and did normal stuff. Had to focus on project so I couldn't do more roblox studio, but it's okay.
