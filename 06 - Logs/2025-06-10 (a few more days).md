### What I did these days:
This Log is a bit special since I've been missing on a few things.
Worked a bit on the project of final year, specifically on [[Reinforcement Learning]]
I worked on the [[Beat up Game]] for a bit too, added basic M1 block combat, ragdoll, throwing objects (not 100% complete yet).
I been thinking about certain things in life, not sure what I can conclude on but I really want to be good at roblox game dev, make games that reflect me, people that play it.
Played touhou mystia, been having more fun with Remilia, my friendships are actually prety nice and stable..
Installed Wine to try and play some games
I also bought [[Brilliant]]! thanks to [[Crin]]
