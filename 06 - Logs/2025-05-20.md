### What I did today:
- Today I worked on the school project, I had to make changes to the [[PrÃ©sentation Review 2]] and make a few changes on the code, to check they're good enough. [[Changement Applications]]
* I started using Obsidian and learnt how to use it using the [[Introduction Videos to Obsidian]] that helped me a lot on how to use this app.
* I started writing on [[What's Rogue Lineage]] to start understanding the perspective they hold behind and what I could do for my own game that is inspired by it.
* I also made a [[Rogue Lineage-Inspired Project Index]] for the future to help me with ideas.
