2025-05-23 (Project: #daily-life #school #projet-final #linux-mint)

### What I did today:
- I tested Sober for Roblox, the creators said it's safe and that even Roblox helped!
- Checking on Reinforcement Learning
- Installed Linux Mint (was pure hell to install) Had issues with installing it on my 1TB new drive. When I Installed nvidia drivers, my 2nd screen stopped working and it was so annoying that when I tried to reinstall mint, I just had "import mok" issues.
