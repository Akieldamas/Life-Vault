Beat up Game was a small game idea that I got while coding the combat of the [[Rogue Lineage-Like]] that I wanted to make. Seeing how silly the combat looked, and the reactions of my friends watching me coding was also funny.
Remilia said that it's a "bullying simulator" which I laughed at it. But that actually gave ideas.
The game would be inspired off Item Asylum/Allusions but I do not like the RNG loadout aspect so you everyone has a simple combat.
The maps would be small, kind of like Blood Debt (a house, a small city, etc.) The player would be able to grab objects (vases, plants, chairs) and throw them onto people. 
The game would also feature finding random weapons on the floor to keep things interesting, like a bat or a gun, it's all around silliness and fun, although it still is a "fighting" game...
I was also thinking on Emotes to keep the game more fun and interactive, people could socialize a bit more than kill and leave.

Features (summarizing above):
* Small maps (house, small city, cinema room)
* Throwing objects that you can pick up (vase, plants, chairs)
* Emotes (to dance, socialize)
* Random weapons on floor (bat, gun)
