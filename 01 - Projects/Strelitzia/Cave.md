General idea:
A big cave area that leads to smaller rooms
and add different paths to those rooms:
for example
a small ravine with a wooden bridge

that connects to another place
or
ladders that connect to an upper section above
or like i said
a small hole you see that leads to a tight tunnel
(barely visible)
and leads to a more secret area (the one for the white flower)
maybe even a small lake..

### add more up and down (height difference)

Entrance:

11/06/2025 Cave state, the black is the void, I'll have to build the ravine around that path.
