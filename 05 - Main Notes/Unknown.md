## Main Thoughts / Notes
The unknown in **Rogue Lineage** is shown through the fact that originally, everything was "unknown". You don't know what you are meant to do, so all you do is just explore the map, what's in front of you. As the player explores, he visits different places, finds random items that he doesn't know what to do till he finds a merchant for the first time in a city.

The game has [[Class]]es with requirements, we didn't know how to obtain them, whenever someone was super strong, you'd wonder how he managed to do that... It was all about trying things, finding hints.. using them.
