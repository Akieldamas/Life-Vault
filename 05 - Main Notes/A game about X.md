While listening to [[Irisu Syndrome]]'s OST, I started thinking about a game that talks about a certain topic, like **trust**.
It made me remind of some horror roblox game about where you walk in a line, grass, white fog. And sometimes there's rocky spheres.
Loud noises, screens (not monsters but like glitch effects, etc), sometimes crashing.
And more importantly, apparently leak classified docs or probably scary docs in general that people just don't know about and yet exist to the public's view.

Also reminded me of Iltria's game, I'll have to think more about it.

I certain want to use [[Irisu Syndrome's OST]]...
