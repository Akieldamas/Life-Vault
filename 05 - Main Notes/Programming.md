 #struggles

***Excitement***
***Confusion***
***Frustration***
***Abandonment***

**Negative Feedback Loop (the wall)

**Identity shifting: Belief**
Unconscious Self Sabotage: Putting less effort to avoid more evidence of failure (unconsciously)
Watching toturials, reading code instead of writing code..


Break the Cycle:
- The Competence-Confidence Loop
### Step 1: 
Choose a Micro Project (something you actually care about)
### Step 2: Break it down into milestones
Break into chunks that produce visible results
Ex: 
Day 1: create basic HTML
Day 3:  STYLE WITH SIMPLE css
Day 5: add working buttons

### Step 3:
Do something specific to mark your success
Take a screen shot of what you built, post on discord, explain what you built.
Keep a wins journal (documenting eveything)

### Step 4:
Find struggle partner. Someone checks progress, listen to you explain, celebrate, ask what's next, even if it's not a tech person.

Implement 30 mins rule:
Don't stay suck for 30 mins. Look for answers. Move to a different part of your project.
Ask someone more experienced, etc. (It's normal to be stuck)
