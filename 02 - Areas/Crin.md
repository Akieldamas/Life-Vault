Crin is a Romanian youtuber that makes videos about Programming and Cybersecurity. I randomly found his channel in a way I cannot even remember.
I watched pretty much all of his videos. Some videos he talks about guides on learning Cybersecurity, certifications, interviews, CVs and more. Some videos he talked about projects he made like a OSU! AI with python, he made farm scripts on a Skyblock MC server with [[Minescript]]. He seems to be a cool guy.

He's 22, very close to my age. The reason I probably like enjoying him is because he's honest, and shows the true colours behind things. And the fact he's close to my age makes me feel like I can relate to him more. Obviously he's far ahead of me, programming skills, had a Cybersecurity job and more (NOT SELF SHAMING MYSELF!).

His wishes seem to be revolving around making content that took him effort, like a project (the skyblock one) and showing to people how it works, what he did, the problems, and more.
However, people and Youtube see him as a "cybersecurity" youtuber, so none of his videos other than Cybersecurity get famous (5K views vs 200K bruh).

"I hate Cybersecurity, I am quitting."
"I want to make honest, high effort content"

The fact videos of Cybersecurity is to farm easy cash and promote something than actually showing the real colors of it is a bit sad.

### Important
A quote I wanted to keep from him:
"Motivation and learning will never work. You'll never feel motivated to work, learning sucks and always will, you have to push it through."
