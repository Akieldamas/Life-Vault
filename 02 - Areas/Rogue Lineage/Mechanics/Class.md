A class in Rogue Lineage is the style of [[Game Progression]] which the game introduces.
It consists on having certain trainers around the map that teaches you skills.
Trainers have different requirements:
* Alignment (killing people or doing good quests or good things)
* XP (through killing monsters, fighting people)
* Specific class quest dedicated to the trainer (Oni having to kill Lava Snake)

Those trainers give [[Abilities]], which are UNIQUE to the class (except stupid navaran that can copy)
