A **Race** is a mechanic in Rogue Lineage and many Rogue Lineage-like games like **The Vast Realm** where when a player first joins the game, a random race is rolled.

A race gives players an unique appearance. (Obviously)
For example Azael is a demon-like race. So he has features like horns, and has red-coloured skin.

Races also give the player custom abilities, whether they're [[Passive Skills]] or [[Active Skills]].
Another example with Azael, is the fact that he has Snap Gate upon spawn, which allows him to teleport around the map very easily.
