# **Permadeath**
[[Permadeath]] is a mechanic popularised by Rogue Lineage which consists in creating the possibility of losing your [[Game Progression]]. For example, Rogue Lineage introduced this idea through a system of [[Limited Lives]] where dying enough times will cause you to restart from 0.
