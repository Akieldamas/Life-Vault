Rogue Lineage is a game who first started as a closed community, and such stayed the same for a while, even after it became open (paid access), the game did get more players, but it remained that same community. 

Rogue Lineage is a "difficult" game. The gameplay surrounds in the following:
* Spawn with a random [[Race]]
* Explore the world [[Map]]
* Obtain a [[Class]]
*  [[Permadeath]]

## Why is it good?

You have to be careful with what you do, especially on the fact that you can lose a life after dying, which causes fear. Because you truly lose something, you don't just respawn.
Back then, information was unknown, and things were [[Unknown]].
However, even the present is not so bad, the fact that things are more known, a  [[Wikis and Meta-Knowledge]] exists.
