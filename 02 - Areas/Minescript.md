Minescript is a Minecraft mod that allows the player to run python scripts into Minecraft. It also offers vast methods that allow you to see players, inventory contents, chest contents, entities, control the character, type in the chat and much much more.

A youtuber I follow called [[Crin]] made a video about it where he worked for lots of hours a project where he joined a minecraft's skyblock server with an economy system and made scripts (farming, selling, fishing, mining, etc.) and became extremely rich quickly.

I asked during his coding stream about anti cheat and he says that you just have to find a way to bypass it, sometimes you gotta put an effort, sometimes not (like the server he was in)
